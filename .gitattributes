# 1) Normalize line endings consistently
#    Stores LF in the repo; converts to your OS line endings in the working tree as needed.
* text=auto

# Scripts are safest with LF (important on Linux/macOS)
*.sh         text eol=lf
*.bash       text eol=lf
*.yaml       text eol=lf
*.yml        text eol=lf
*.json       text eol=lf
*.md         text eol=lf
*.tf         text eol=lf

# Likewise, force cmd and batch scripts to always use crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.bat text eol=crlf

# 2) Treat common binary files as binary (no line-ending changes, no text diffs)
#    'binary' implies -text -diff
*.png        binary
*.jpg        binary
*.jpeg       binary
*.gif        binary
*.webp       binary
*.ico        binary
*.pdf        binary
*.zip        binary
*.7z         binary
*.gz         binary
*.rar        binary
*.tar        binary
*.tar.gz     binary
*.ttf        binary
*.otf        binary
*.woff       binary
*.woff2      binary
*.psd        binary
*.ai         binary

# 3) Configuration & lock files as plain text (default), but you may choose stricter merging later
*.lock       text
